    <p>Dear Dean,</p>
    <p>
        Enclosed you will find a term paper which was turned in as a class assignment for [course title], [academic
        quarter], by [student's name]. The work struck me as being unlike the student's earlier papers, and portions of
        the research sounded familiar. I did some checking and discovered that the majority of the paper is lifted
        directly from [source] without attribution. I have included the source, and have marked sample passages on the
        term paper with their corresponding pages in the source. I have also included a copy of the syllabus with my
        instructions on plagiarism, and a copy of the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>Please find below students details:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jill</td>
            <td>Smith</td>
            <td>50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eve</td>
            <td>Jackson</td>
            <td>94</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>Doe</td>
            <td>80</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        I did meet with the student on [date], and he/she stated that she did copy the paper, but that s/he had been ill
        and was unable to complete the assignment on his/her own. He/she appeared genuinely contrite, but it seemed
        clear that he/she knew he/she should have given credit to the original author. According to your instructions, I
        have assigned the student a grade of DR and am referring the incident to your office.
    </p>
    <p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
